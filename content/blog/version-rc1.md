## Markdown Sync RC1

We are excited to announce the first release candidate of Markdown Sync. This release includes major features that make publishing markdown content faster, smarter, and more collaborative.

---

### Semantic Search with Vector Embeddings

Search now understands meaning, not just keywords. Every post is automatically embedded as vectors in Convex, enabling semantic search across your entire content library.

[Learn more about search](/docs-search)

---

### Dashboard Cloud CMS with ConvexFS Media Library

The dashboard now includes a full cloud CMS experience. Upload, organize, and manage media assets directly from the browser using the [ConvexFS Media Library](https://convexfs.dev/).

ConvexFS was built by Jamie Turner, Convex co-founder and CEO. It provides file storage that syncs in real-time with the rest of your Convex data.

### OpenCode AI Development Tool Integration

Full support for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), the AI-first development tool. This framework includes agents, commands, skills, and plugins that work alongside Claude Code and Cursor.

[Read the OpenCode docs](/docs-opencode)

---

### Version Control with Enhanced Diff Rendering

Track changes to your content with built-in version control. The enhanced diff code block rendering highlights additions and deletions clearly, making it easy to review changes before publishing.

### Ask AI with RAG-Based Q&A

Click the Ask AI button in the header to ask questions about your content. Answers are generated using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), pulling relevant context from your posts to provide accurate responses.
